## Tables

### `auth.users` (Supabase Auth — not in `public`)

Managed by Supabase Auth. Each row gets a matching `profiles` row via trigger `on_auth_user_created`.

| Field (common) | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| `id` | UUID — same as `profiles.id` |
| `email` | Login email |
| `phone` | Optional; used for OTP login |

---

### `profiles`

One row per authenticated user. **`role` is the authorization source of truth.**

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | — | FK → `auth.users(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE |
| `role` | `user_role` | `customer` | Only admin/service-role can change (trigger `lock_role`) |
| `full_name` | `text` | null | |
| `phone` | `text` | null | Unique when set (partial index) |
| `wallet_balance` | `numeric(10,2)` | `0` | Added in `0006` |
| `onesignal_id` | `text` | null | OneSignal player id for push (`0007`) |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |

**RLS:** User reads/updates own row; admin reads all.

**App roles → routes**

| `role` | Portal |
|--------|--------|
| `customer` | `/`, `/checkout`, `/orders` |
| `restaurant` | `/vendor`, `/vendor/menu`, `/vendor/earnings` |
| `driver` | `/driver` |
| `admin` | `/admin` |

---

### `restaurants`

A shop / restaurant listing. Vendor account = `profiles` where `role = 'restaurant'` and `restaurants.owner_id = profiles.id`.

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `owner_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `profiles(id)` |
| `slug` | `text` UNIQUE | — | URL: `/restaurant/[slug]` |
| `name` | `text` | — | Display name |
| `tagline` | `text` | null | |
| `is_open` | `boolean` | `true` | Vendor toggle (`/vendor` header) |
| `approved` | `boolean` | `false` | Must be true for customer browse (unless owner) |
| `image_url` | `text` | null | Cover image (`0002`) |
| `accent_tint` | `text` | null | CSS gradient fallback |
| `cuisines` | `text[]` | `{}` | e.g. `{"Fast Food","North Indian"}` |
| `rating` | `numeric(2,1)` | `4.5` | |
| `rating_count` | `integer` | `0` | |
| `eta_min` | `integer` | null | Minutes |
| `eta_max` | `integer` | null | Minutes |
| `price_tier` | `smallint` | `2` | 1 = ₹, 2 = ₹₹, 3 = ₹₹₹ |
| `cost_for_two` | `integer` | null | Whole rupees |
| `distance_km` | `numeric(4,1)` | null | |
| `offer` | `text` | null | Promo line on card |
| `promoted` | `boolean` | `false` | Home feed boost |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |

**Indexes:** `owner_id`

**Legacy PHP mapping:** `shop` table → `restaurants`  
**Legacy slug pattern:** `shop-name-{legacy_shop_id}` e.g. `burger-republic`, `chhitiz-swad-restaurant-126`

**RLS:** Customers read `approved = true`; owners read/manage own rows; admin all.

**DAL:** [`src/lib/data-access/restaurants.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/restaurants.ts), [`vendor-restaurant.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/vendor-restaurant.ts)

### `menu_items`

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `restaurant_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `restaurants(id)` |
| `name` | `text` | — | |
| `description` | `text` | null | |
| `price` | `integer` | — | **Whole rupees** (₹), ≥ 0 |
| `veg` | `boolean` | `true` | |
| `available` | `boolean` | `true` | `false` = sold out on customer UI |
| `external_id` | `text` | null | Legacy import id e.g. `legacy-260` |

| `image_url` | `text` | null | |
| `popular` | `boolean` | `false` | |
| `bestseller` | `boolean` | `false` | |
| `sort_order` | `integer` | `0` | Vendor display order (`0009`) |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |

**Unique:** `(restaurant_id, external_id)` where `external_id` is not null

**Storage:** public bucket `menu-images` — object path `{restaurant_id}/{filename}`; owners write via `owns_restaurant()` (`0009`)

**Legacy PHP mapping:** `products` → `menu_items` (`status ON/OFF` → `available`)

**RLS:** Public read for approved restaurants; owner CRUD via `owns_restaurant()`.

**DAL:** [`vendor-menu.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/vendor-menu.ts)

### `orders`

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `customer_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `profiles(id)` |
| `restaurant_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `restaurants(id)` |
| `status` | `order_status` | `placed` | See enum flow above |
| `total` | `integer` | `0` | **Server-computed** (items + fees), ≥ 0 |
| `delivery_fee` | `integer` | `0` | Whole rupees (`0002`) |
| `tax_amount` | `integer` | `0` | Whole rupees (`0002`) |
| `address` | `jsonb` | null | See shape below |
| `pickup_otp` | `text` | random 4-digit | Restaurant handover (`0006`) |
| `delivery_otp` | `text` | random 4-digit | Rider handover (`0006`) |
| `discount` | `integer` | `0` | Rupees off the grand total. Written only by `apply_coupon_to_order()` (`0031`) |
| `coupon_code` | `text` | null | Snapshot of the code used; no FK, so deleting a coupon can't rewrite history (`0031`) |
| `channel` | `text` | `'app'` | `app` \| `phone` — how the order was taken (`0029`) |
| `placed_by` | `uuid` | null | FK → `profiles(id)` SET NULL. The operator who took a phone order; null for an app order (`0029`) |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |

> This column list is not exhaustive past `0012`: `tip` (`0013`),
> `external_id` (`0015`), `payment_method` / `payment_status` (`0025`) and
> `accepted_at` / `ready_at` / `cancelled_at` (`0026`) are also on this table.
> Read the migrations for the full shape.

**`address` JSON shape**

`line` is the full findable address, not a summary: checkout concatenates the
saved street line with the apartment, entry code, floor, building name and
courier note. It is what the rider's board prints and what `mapsDirectionsUrl`
geocodes when the pin is absent. `lat`/`lng` are the delivery pin — optional
(an address saved before the map picker has none), and what the 500 m arrival
notification measures against.

```json
{
  "label": "Home",
  "line": "402, Ashirwad Residency, Koramangala 5th Block, Bengaluru, Gate 2",
  "lat": 21.7157,
  "lng": 81.5335
}
```

Optional `lat` / `lng` may be added from map picker.

**Indexes:** `customer_id`, `restaurant_id`

**RLS:** Customer own orders; restaurant own `restaurant_id`; driver assigned active delivery; manager read + advance `status` (`0023`); admin all.

**INSERT** is `customer_id = auth.uid()` plus a role in (`customer`,
`admin`) — admin joined as of `0040` so the owner's own account, which is an
admin, can shop through the customer app. It inserts as *itself*; posting an
order in another person's name is still the phone-order path below. Because
admin reads every row, customer-facing screens ask `listMyOrders()`
(`customer_id = me`) rather than leaning on RLS to scope the list.

**Column guard:** `guard_order_update()` — anyone who is not admin or the
service role may move `status` and nothing else. `channel`, `placed_by`,
`discount` and `coupon_code` are on that locked list. It is **SECURITY INVOKER**
as of `0030`, deliberately: as DEFINER it read its own owner as `current_user`
and could not tell a trusted server function from a customer, which is the
whole job. `total` is also pinned at INSERT (`0030`), so it cannot be posted
directly.

**No manager INSERT policy — on purpose.** Phone orders are written by
`placePhoneOrder()` through the service role, which stamps `placed_by`. See
SECURITY.md → "Manager".

**DAL:** [`orders.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/orders.ts), [`vendor-orders.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/vendor-orders.ts), [`admin-orders.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/admin-orders.ts), [`manager-orders.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/manager-orders.ts), [`manager-phone-orders.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/manager-phone-orders.ts)

**Vendor board filters:** `status IN ('placed','kitchen','ready')` for active kitchen columns.

---

### `order_items`

Line items snapshotted at order time (price/name frozen even if menu changes).

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `order_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `orders(id)` CASCADE |
| `menu_item_id` | `uuid` | null | FK → `menu_items(id)` SET NULL |
| `name` | `text` | — | Snapshot |
| `qty` | `integer` | — | > 0 |
| `price` | `integer` | — | Unit price snapshot, whole rupees |

**Index:** `order_id`

**RLS:** Visibility follows parent order.

---

### `deliveries`

One delivery row per order (1:1, enforced by the UNIQUE on `order_id`).

Since `0042` the row can exist **before** anybody is carrying the order: dispatch
writes an `unassigned` row holding an offer the moment the vendor accepts. Code
that asks "does this order have a rider?" must therefore test `driver_id` (or
`status <> 'unassigned'`), never the mere existence of the row.

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `order_id` | `uuid` UNIQUE | — | FK → `orders(id)` |
| `driver_id` | `uuid` | null | FK → `profiles(id)`. Null until a rider **accepts** |
| `status` | `delivery_status` | `unassigned` | |
| `assigned_at` | `timestamptz` | null | |
| `picked_up_at` | `timestamptz` | null | Start of the road leg (`0008`) |
| `delivered_at` | `timestamptz` | null | |
| `driver_lat` | `double precision` | null | Last reported fix (`0008`) |
| `driver_lng` | `double precision` | null | (`0008`) |
| `driver_location_at` | `timestamptz` | null | When that fix arrived (`0008`) |
| `driver_location_source` | `text` | null | `gps` \| `none`. Null/`none` = the customer's map is showing an interpolation and must say so (`0026`) |
| `offered_driver_id` | `uuid` | null | FK → `profiles(id)` SET NULL. Who dispatch picked — a first refusal, **not** an assignment (`0042`) |
| `offered_at` | `timestamptz` | null | Start of the exclusivity window (`EXCLUSIVE_OFFER_MS`, `0042`) |
| `arrival_notified_at` | `timestamptz` | null | Once-only latch behind the 500 m "your rider is here" push (`0042`) |
| `cod_collected_amount` | `integer` | null | Rupees the rider confirmed collecting at the door, for a cash-on-delivery order. Written once, when the order is marked delivered (`0045`) |
| `cod_collected_at` | `timestamptz` | null | When the collection was recorded (`0045`) |

**Index:** `driver_id`; partial index on `offered_driver_id` (`0042`)

**RLS:** unchanged by `0042` — `driver_id = auth.uid()`, the owning vendor, or
admin. The offered rider is deliberately *not* admitted: see the header of
`0042_rider_dispatch.sql` for why that clause would leak one rider's live
position to another. The driver board reads this table service-role behind
`requireRole("driver")`.

**DAL:** [`driver-orders.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/driver-orders.ts),
[`rider-dispatch.ts`](../src/lib/dispatch/rider-dispatch.ts)

### `refunds`

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `order_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `orders(id)` |
| `amount` | `integer` | — | Whole rupees |
| `reason` | `text` | null | |
| `status` | `refund_status` | `pending` | |
| `decided_by` | `uuid` | null | FK → `profiles(id)` admin |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |

**RLS:** Customer request + read own; admin approve/deny.

---

### `settlement_corrections`

A debit against a vendor's future settlement, created when a refund is
approved for an order whose payout was already paid out. Closes the gap the
codebase's own comments used to name directly: `flagSettlementForRefund()`
said "there is no automatic clawback", and `voidSettlement()` still refuses to
reverse a paid batch with "record a correction instead" (`0046`).

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `restaurant_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `restaurants(id)` |
| `order_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `orders(id)` |
| `refund_id` | `uuid` | null | FK → `refunds(id)` SET NULL |
| `original_settlement_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `vendor_settlements(id)`. The settlement that paid the vendor for this order in the first place |
| `applied_settlement_id` | `uuid` | null | FK → `vendor_settlements(id)` SET NULL. The settlement that actually recovered it, once one exists |
| `amount` | `integer` | — | Whole rupees to recover, > 0. Computed from the drop in the order's settlement `contribution` once the refund is included, via the same `lineFor()` arithmetic every other settlement figure uses, never invented |
| `reason` | `text` | null | |
| `status` | `correction_status` | `outstanding` | `outstanding` \| `applied` \| `voided` |
| `created_by` | `uuid` | — | FK → `profiles(id)`, the admin who approved the triggering refund |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |
| `applied_at` | `timestamptz` | null | |

A draft (not yet paid) settlement never needs a row here: voiding and
rebuilding it prices a late-landing refund correctly through the normal
per-line arithmetic, since the order simply re-enters the next preview. This
table exists only for money that has already left the building — a refund
approved after a **paid** settlement.

**Applied automatically:** every outstanding correction for a vendor is netted
into `net_payable` the next time a settlement (draft or instant) is written
for them, and marked `applied` with a trace to that settlement
(`writeSettlement()` in `admin-settlements.ts`). Voiding a settlement that had
absorbed a correction reverts it to `outstanding`.

**RLS:** Admin read only — a manager has no role in vendor settlements
anywhere else in this schema (`0023`), so this table does not extend that
grant. No insert, update or delete policy for any authenticated role: every
write goes through the service role, reached only behind
`requireRole("admin")`, the same shape as `vendor_settlements` itself.

**DAL:** [`admin-settlements.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/admin-settlements.ts) (`createSettlementCorrection`, `outstandingCorrectionsFor`), consumed from [`refunds.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/refunds.ts)

### `addresses`

Saved customer delivery addresses.

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `user_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `profiles(id)` |
| `label` | `text` | `'Home'` | e.g. Home, Work |
| `line` | `text` | — | Full address string |
| `lat` | `double precision` | null | |
| `lng` | `double precision` | null | |
| `is_default` | `boolean` | `false` | Only one default per user (trigger) |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |

**API:** `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/addresses`, `POST /api/addresses`

---

### `reviews`

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `order_id` | `uuid` UNIQUE | — | One review per order |
| `user_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `profiles(id)` |
| `restaurant_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `restaurants(id)` |
| `rating` | `integer` | — | 1–5 |
| `comment` | `text` | null | |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |

**RLS:** Public read; customer insert only on own **delivered** order.

**API:** `POST /api/reviews`

---

### `wallet_transactions`

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `user_id` | `uuid` | — | FK → `profiles(id)` |
| `amount` | `numeric(10,2)` | — | Positive = credit, negative = debit |
| `reason` | `text` | — | |
| `order_id` | `uuid` | null | FK → `orders(id)` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |

**RLS:** User read own; writes are **service-role only** (client cannot credit self).

---

### `cod_handovers`

Digital record of one leg of the cash-on-delivery handover chain: Customer to
rider, rider to manager, manager to owner. The cash itself can move offline;
this table is what makes that movement auditable, per the confirmed rule that
offline execution must never mean an untracked transaction (`0045`).

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `leg` | `cash_handover_leg` | — | `rider_to_manager` \| `manager_to_owner` |
| `from_user` | `uuid` | null | FK → `profiles(id)` SET NULL |
| `to_user` | `uuid` | null | FK → `profiles(id)` SET NULL |
| `amount` | `integer` | — | Whole rupees, >= 0 |
| `handover_date` | `date` | `current_date` | Set from IST at write time by the app, not left to the server's own time zone |
| `note` | `text` | null | |
| `recorded_by` | `uuid` | — | FK → `profiles(id)`. Who entered the row, not always `from_user` or `to_user` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |

Not tied to individual orders: a rider hands over a shift's cash in one
amount, not order by order. Reconciling a handover total against
`deliveries.cod_collected_amount` for the same period is shown side by side on
`/admin/cash-ledger`, but is not enforced.

**RLS:** Admin and manager read all rows. No insert, update or delete policy
for any authenticated role: every write goes through the service role from
[`cod-handovers.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/cod-handovers.ts), behind
`requireRole(["manager", "admin"])`, the same shape as `vendor_settlements`
(`0028`). Never updated after creation; a correction is a new row.

**DAL:** [`cod-handovers.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/cod-handovers.ts)

**UI:** `/manager/cash` (record), `/admin/cash-ledger` (owner's view)

---

### `operational_expenses`

A Deligro cost recorded here, whatever the underlying payment channel. Not an
accounts-payable system: no invoices, no approval workflow, no payment
execution. Rider salary, EV bike maintenance and charging, and other small
operational spend can be paid however is practical for a single tier-3 city;
this table is only the digital record that the cost happened (`0045`).

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `category` | `expense_category` | — | `rider_salary` \| `ev_bike_maintenance` \| `ev_bike_charging` \| `rider_other` \| `small_expense` \| `other` |
| `amount` | `integer` | — | Whole rupees, >= 0 |
| `driver_id` | `uuid` | null | FK → `profiles(id)` SET NULL. Named to match `deliveries.driver_id`; the product calls this role "rider" everywhere above the schema. Set only when the expense is tied to one rider |
| `payment_method` | `expense_payment_method` | `offline_cash` | `offline_cash` \| `offline_bank` \| `upi` \| `other` |
| `expense_date` | `date` | `current_date` | Set from IST at write time by the app |
| `note` | `text` | null | |
| `recorded_by` | `uuid` | — | FK → `profiles(id)` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | |

Every amount here classifies as a **Deligro cost**, never revenue. EV bike
allocation (which bike belongs to which rider) is deliberately not tracked
here; it stays an offline register by design. Only the rupee amount, when one
is financially material, gets a record.

**RLS:** Same shape as `cod_handovers`: admin and manager read all rows,
service-role-only writes behind `requireRole(["manager", "admin"])`.

**DAL:** [`operational-expenses.ts`](../src/lib/data-access/operational-expenses.ts)

**Seed coupons:** `WELCOME50`, `FLAT30` (in migration `0006`)

**API:** `POST /api/coupons/validate`

### `otp_codes`

Server-only OTP storage for phone login. **No RLS policies** — only service-role can access.

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | `uuid` PK | `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `phone` | `text` | — | E.164 e.g. `+919876543210` |
| `code_hash` | `text` | — | `sha256(code + phone + pepper)` |
| `attempts` | `integer` | `0` | Lock after too many wrong tries |
| `consumed` | `boolean` | `false` | |
| `expires_at` | `timestamptz` | — | |

| Legacy MySQL (`deligro-php`) | Supabase table | Notes |
|------------------------------|----------------|-------|
| `shop` | `restaurants` | `status ON/OFF` → `is_open` |
| `products` | `menu_items` | `status ON/OFF` → `available` |
| `category` | `menu_items.category` | Category name as text |
| `orders` | `orders` | **Not fully imported yet** — only new app orders |
| `user` | `profiles` + `auth.users` | Customers imported via `db:import-legacy-customers` |
| `shop.email` / `shop.phone` | vendor `auth.users` | `db:import-legacy-owners` |

---

## Useful scripts

```bash
npm run db:seed-users          # Demo vendor/driver/admin accounts
npm run db:seed                # Seed catalog from src/lib/data.ts (6 demo restaurants)
npm run db:import-legacy       # Import legacy shops + menu from JSON export
npm run db:import-legacy-owners # Link each shop to a vendor auth account
npm run db:import-legacy-customers
```

**Demo vendor login:** `vendor@deligro.demo` / `DeligroDemo1!` (owns 6 seed restaurants — use header dropdown on `/vendor`)

## Common SQL snippets

**Count everything**

```sql
select
  (select count(*) from profiles) as profiles,
  (select count(*) from restaurants) as restaurants,
  (select count(*) from menu_items) as menu_items,
  (select count(*) from orders) as orders;
```

**Orders for one restaurant**

```sql
select o.id, o.status, o.total, o.created_at
from orders o
join restaurants r on r.id = o.restaurant_id
where r.slug = 'burger-republic'
order by o.created_at desc;
```

**Menu for one restaurant**

```sql
select m.name, m.price, m.category, m.available
from menu_items m
join restaurants r on r.id = m.restaurant_id
where r.slug = 'burger-republic'
order by m.category, m.name;
```

**Who owns a restaurant**

```sql
select r.name, r.slug, p.full_name, p.role, u.email
from restaurants r
join profiles p on p.id = r.owner_id
join auth.users u on u.id = p.id
where r.slug = 'burger-republic';
```

## Money & types convention

- **All prices in DB are whole rupees** (`integer`) unless noted (`numeric` for wallet/coupons).
- **App UI** uses `formatINR()` from `src/lib/utils/format.ts`.
- **IDs** are UUIDs in Postgres; UI shows short codes via `shortOrderId()`.
