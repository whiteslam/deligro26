-- Read-only RLS / grant verification for the LIVE Supabase project.
-- Paste into Supabase -> SQL editor and run each block. Nothing here writes.
-- Source: docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md section 1, plus a migration-applied check.

-- 1. Tables in public with RLS off, or on with zero policies.
--    Expected: every row has rls_on = true. policies = 0 is fine ONLY for the
--    service-role-only tables (obs_*, rate_limits, vendor_login_credentials,
--    payments writes, coupon_redemptions writes, etc.).

-- 3. SECURITY DEFINER functions that anon can execute.
--    Expected: only deliberate public ones (menu_item_popularity, preview_coupon
--    style lookups). Anything that writes is a finding.
