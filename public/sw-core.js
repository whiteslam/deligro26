/* Deligro service worker — caching, offline, and update plumbing.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS NOT THE REGISTERED WORKER
 * ------------------------------------------
 * OneSignal owns the one service-worker registration this origin can have at
 * scope "/" (`/OneSignalSDKWorker.js`, registered by the v16 SDK). A second
 * `register()` at the same scope REPLACES the first, so registering an app
 * worker of our own would silently tear down push — and push is how a rider
 * learns there is an order waiting. So there is exactly one worker file, and
 * this module is pulled into it with `importScripts`.
 *
 * That also gives update detection for free: the spec has browsers re-fetch a
 * worker's imported scripts during an update check (this is what
 * `updateViaCache: "imports"` means), so a change to THIS file installs a new
 * worker even though OneSignalSDKWorker.js itself never changes.
 *
 * Plain JS on purpose — `public/` is served verbatim, so there is no build step
 * to strip types, and Turbopack never sees this file.

 * happened to request them while online — when they 404 the router throws and

 * screen was verified present in the cache and still failed to match, because
 * the lookup request's router headers did not equal the ones it was stored
 * with. Every entry these caches hold is a whole document or a static asset —
