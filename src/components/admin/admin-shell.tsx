/**
 * Admin chrome with an app ↔ web switch (desktop/laptop only).
 *
 * - web (default on a computer): sidebar + top bar console
 * - app: the phone frame, for checking how the portal reads on a handset
 *
 * On a real phone the switcher is hidden and the phone shell is forced, so the
 * console layout is never something a handset has to cope with.
 *
 * `initialMode` is resolved **on the server** (`lib/shell-mode.server.ts`) and
 * is what this renders for the hydration pass, so the console is the console in
 * the very first byte of HTML. Before that it was decided client-side only,
 * which meant SSR always answered "app" and every console page shipped as a
 * 402px iPhone mock that swapped to the console a paint later.
 *
 * Both branches wrap page content in `@container`. Pages therefore size
 * themselves against *the column they are in*, not the browser window — the
 * same table can be a real grid in the console and stacked cards inside the
 * 390px phone frame, on one desktop viewport where a `md:` breakpoint would
 * wrongly report "wide" for both.
 *
 * `console-theme` is on the web branch only. It carries the ops-console
 * palette (see globals.css), so the phone frame keeps the app's own look —
 * which is the honest thing for a preview of a handset to do.
