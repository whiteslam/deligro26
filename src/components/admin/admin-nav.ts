/**
 * One nav definition, three consumers: the web sidebar, the phone bottom tabs,
 * and the top bar's page title. The phone frame can only carry five tabs, so
 * `primary` marks the five that earn a slot there — everything else the phone
 * can use is one tap away inside Settings, and the rail lists all of it.
 *
 * The five tabs are chosen for what an operator does *away from a desk*:
 * Dashboard, Orders, Refunds, Vendors, Settings. Campaigns is a rail item
 * rather than a tab because both of its authoring routes are console-only —
 * spending a fifth of the phone's navigation on "pause a banner" is a poor
 * trade against Refunds, which is a pure decision queue and carries a badge.
 *
 * Team and Platform configuration are settings *sub*-pages that the rail lists
 * directly: the console has the room, and burying a daily job like creating a
 * staff login two taps deep is only a phone compromise. The Settings menu drops
 * those rows in web mode (see admin/settings/page.tsx) so the rail is the one
 * place they appear there.
 *
 * `reach: "console"` marks the rail entries a phone should never be offered at
 * all, because the screen behind them is console-only (see ConsoleOnly). They
 * stay in the rail and keep their page title; they just don't appear in the
 * phone's Settings menu, where tapping through would only find a notice.
