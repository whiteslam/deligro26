/**
 * The other half of the approval decision: decline a signup.
 *
 * Approve was the only verb on the queue, so the honest way to say no was to
 * leave the card sitting there — which is how a queue of six becomes a queue of
 * twenty with a median wait measured in months. Rejecting suspends the shop, so
 * it leaves the queue and the nav badge without being erased; the confirm names
 * what happens next in the same sentence, because "reject" reads as "delete" to
 * an operator who has never seen the vendor's row afterwards.
