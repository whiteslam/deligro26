/**
 * "Vendors waiting to go live" — the approval queue as a decision list rather
 * than a link to one. This is the redesign's fix for the clumsy approvals
 * flow: the common case (a shop that has been waiting three days and just
 * needs a yes) is now one click from the dashboard, with no navigation.
 *
 * Oldest first, because a queue worked newest-first is a queue with a tail
 * nobody ever reaches.
 *
 * There is deliberately no Reject here. `restaurants` models approval as a
 * boolean, so the only "no" this schema can express is deletion — and wiring a
 * one-click destructive action into a dashboard card is not a rejection flow,
 * it is an accident waiting to happen. Review opens the vendor, where the
 * suspend and delete controls live behind their own confirmations.
