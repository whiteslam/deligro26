/**
 * Tools that only work at console width, and an honest note where they aren't.
 *
 * The admin runs in two shells: the console, and a ~370px phone column that a
 * real handset is forced into (see AdminShell). A handful of screens are built
 * for the console and cannot be made to work in that column — a 960px vendor
 * table, an eight-step onboarding wizard, the platform fee form. Rather than
 * ship them broken or delete them silently, they are replaced on the phone with
 * a line saying where they went. Nobody should hunt for a feature they know
 * exists.
 *
 * THIS IS PRESENTATION, NOT AUTHORIZATION. Hiding a tool here changes nothing
 * about who may call it: every exported `"use server"` function starts with its
 * own role check (AGENTS.md rule 3), and that is the only thing keeping it safe.
 * Do not read a hidden button as a control.
 *
 * Note on what the gate actually stops: a *server* child passed as `children`
 * still renders on the server — the parent creates the element eagerly, so the
 * query behind it runs either way. What this stops is the *client mount*, which
 * is the part that costs a phone something: `AutoRefresh` polling, Recharts,
 * one live carousel per campaign card, a 1282-line wizard's autosave. Do not
 * "fix" the server half by converting pages to client components.
 *
 * Prefer the `@3xl:` container query over this component when all three hold:
 * the element is cheap and server-rendered, it needs no explanation, and hiding
 * it at 500px in web mode is *also* correct. This component is for the cases
 * where the operator has to be told, because `@3xl` is false in the web console
 * between 480 and 1024px too — a CSS gate would tell someone standing in the
 * console to go find the console.
