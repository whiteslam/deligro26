/**
 * The one place the PWA layer is wired in. Mounted once from the root layout,
 * so every portal gets it — the customer app, and equally the vendor, rider and
 * admin consoles, which is where a dropped connection actually costs someone
 * money.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all in the common case. Every piece below is conditional,
 * and each degrades to null on a browser that cannot do it, so this is inert on
 * anything from an old iOS Safari to a Firefox private window.
 *
 * Overlays go through `PortalToShell` for the same reason every other overlay
 * in this app does: `.app-shell` carries a transform, so a `position: fixed`
 * child rendered outside it would anchor to the viewport and float off the
 * phone frame on desktop.

  // screen, so every anonymous visitor lands there and every visit wiped the
  // caches — verified in a headless-Chrome run, where the precached offline
  // page disappeared between two ordinary navigations.

  // Doing it here rather than on the sign-out buttons is still deliberate:
  // sign-out is a plain <form method="post"> in ten places across four portals
  // with no JavaScript in the path, and each would have had to become a client
  // component to run a callback.
  // Read off `window.location` rather than with `useSearchParams()`. This
  // component lives in the ROOT layout, and `useSearchParams` there opts every
  // page in the app out of static rendering unless it is wrapped in Suspense —
  // a real cost, paid on every route, for a flag that is only ever read once in
