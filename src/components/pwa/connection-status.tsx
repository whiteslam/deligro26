 * The connection pill.
 *
 * Only two states are ever shown, and only one of them persists:
 *
 *   offline  — stays up for as long as the connection is gone, because the user
 *              needs to know why nothing is loading.
 *   back online — a brief confirmation, then it leaves.
 *
 * There is no permanent "online" badge. A green dot that is always lit is
 * furniture: it costs a row of screen on a 402px frame and tells the user
 * something they can already see, which is that the app is working.
