/**
 * The courier app's three screens.
 *
 * Smaller than `vendor-nav.ts` on purpose, and shaped differently: there is no
 * `group` and no `primary` flag because there is no rail to group for and no
 * overflow to demote. A rider has one phone shell and three tabs, all of which
 * fit — the vendor's five-slot squeeze does not exist here.
 *
 * Jobs is first and stays first. It is the screen a rider is holding when they
 * are working; the other two are things they open between deliveries, and
 * neither should ever be what the app opens on.
