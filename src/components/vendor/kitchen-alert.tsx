/**
 * Tells the kitchen an order has arrived.
 *
 * The board had no alert of any kind: arrival was discovered by an 8-second
 * `router.refresh()` that only ran while the tab was visible. A tablet on
 * another tab, asleep, or simply not being watched accumulated orders in
 * silence — a 3-minute acceptance time turning into 30, and every downstream
 * ETA the customer was promised going with it. Server-side push
 * (`notifyVendorNewOrder`) covers a board that isn't running at all; arming
 * here also subscribes the device to it (`requestPushOptIn`).
 *
 * Three channels, because a kitchen defeats any one of them: a tone loud enough
 * to hear over extraction fans, a vibration for a tablet on a steel counter, and
 * a system notification for when the tab is in the background.
 *
 * ## Why this needs a button
 *
 * Neither audio nor notifications can be started by a page on its own — the
 * browser requires a user gesture to unlock an AudioContext, and a user gesture
 * to prompt for Notification permission. So the kitchen arms it once per device
 * and the choice is remembered in localStorage. Nothing here can be enabled
 * behind the operator's back, which is also why the disarmed state is visible
 * rather than silent: a board that looks armed and isn't is the failure this
 * component exists to fix.

 * assume capable) from mismatching the client's.

 * The listener list exists because `storage` events do not fire in the tab that
 * wrote them, so the Mute button has to notify this tab itself.
