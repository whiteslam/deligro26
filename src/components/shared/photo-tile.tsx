 * backdrop while the photo loads (or if it ever fails to).
 *
 * Renders through `next/image` (`fill`, matching this tile's own box) so a
 * real vendor photo — served as whatever size was uploaded, sometimes several
 * MB — gets resized and format-negotiated (AVIF/WebP) for the size it's
 * actually shown at, rather than shipping the original to a 72px tile.
