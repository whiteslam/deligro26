/**
 * Keeps a server-rendered board live without a manual reload: re-runs the
 * server component (router.refresh) on an interval, so fresh DB data flows back
 * into props. Pauses while the tab is hidden and refreshes immediately when it
 * regains focus — near-realtime for the ops boards, no WebSocket wiring needed.
 *
 * `interval={0}` drops the timer and keeps only the catch-up: for a screen
 * with nothing in flight to poll for, where the cost of a poll buys nothing but
 * coming back to a stale page still reads as a bug.
 *
 * `whenHidden` opts out of the pause. Set it where nobody is looking at the tab
 * and that is exactly the problem: the kitchen display is a tablet that spends
 * its day on another tab or asleep, and pausing there meant new orders were not
 * merely un-announced but undiscovered until someone touched the device.
