   subscription that lets React re-read it when the switcher writes.

   `useSyncExternalStore` rather than state-plus-effect for the same reason
   `useIsDesktop` uses it: the hydration render must return the server's answer
   exactly, and the corrected value must arrive as a normal re-render rather
   than a cascading setState inside an effect.

/**
 * One source of truth for "which shell am I in", shared by the chrome and by

 *
 * ## Why this replaced the zustand shell stores
 *
 * They were module-global, so they could not be seeded per request without
 * leaking one operator's preference into another's render. That is why the
 * server had no answer at all and resolved to `"app"` for everyone: the admin
 * console was server-rendered inside a 402px iPhone mock, on every request,
 * and only became the console after hydration. The value now arrives as a prop
 * from the server layout — per-request by construction — and this context
 * carries it down. The stores are deleted rather than kept alongside; two
 * places answering one question is how a shell ends up disagreeing with its own
 * pages.
 *
 * ## The two renders
 *
 * - **Hydration render**: `mode` is exactly the server's answer, so the client
 *   tree matches the HTML. No mismatch, no flash of the wrong shell.
 * - **After mount**: the viewport is measured. A real handset is forced to
 *   `"app"` whatever the cookie says — the console is not something a 390px
 *   screen can cope with — while the cookie keeps the operator's console
 *   preference intact for when they are back at a desk.
 *
 * Fails closed in the sense that matters (AGENTS.md, "never fail open"): a
 * device that cannot be measured, or a page rendered outside this provider,
 * resolves to the phone frame — *fewer* tools plus an explanation, never a
 * console-grade tool dropped into a handset.
