 * A category tile: a photograph of the food, over its gradient.
 *
 * This used to render `/icons/categories/<id>.svg` for four of the eight
 * categories and an emoji for the rest — two visual languages in one strip, and
 * the four SVGs were 1.3–1.9 MB EACH (6.5 MB to draw four 64px tiles, on a
 * Tier-3 mobile connection, above the fold). The photographs that replaced them
 * are ~8 KB apiece from a CDN the CSP already allows.
 *
 * The gradient is not decoration: it is what the tile looks like for the whole
 * time the photo is in flight, which on a slow connection is the part most
 * people see. Same rule as `PhotoTile` for restaurant covers — photography
 * supplies the colour, the gradient holds its place.
