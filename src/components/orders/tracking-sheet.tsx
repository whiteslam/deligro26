 * sheet between the stops in `SHEET_SNAPS` and lets its contents scroll on
 * their own underneath, which is what the handle was promising.
 *
 * Two gestures reach it. Dragging the handle is the obvious one and works with
 * a mouse, a finger or a keyboard. The second is the one people actually try:
 * a finger anywhere in the content. That is claimed only when the pull cannot
 * mean anything else — the list is already at its top and the finger is going
 * down, or the sheet is not fully open and the finger is going up — so an
 * ordinary scroll is never stolen. It needs a non-passive `touchmove` to
 * suppress the native scroll, hence the listener wiring rather than React's
 * (passive) `onTouchMove`.
