/**
 * Loads the OneSignal Web SDK (v16), ties this device's subscription to the
 * signed-in user, and keeps /api/notifications/register told of its id.
 *
 * Mounted in EVERY portal — customer, vendor, driver, manager, admin. It used
 * to live only in the customer layout, so kitchens and riders never had a push
 * subscription at all and every "new order" / "pickup coming" push the server
 * sent went to nobody. The screens that most need a push — a tablet on a shelf,
 * a phone in a rider's pocket — were exactly the ones that could not get one.
 *
 * `OneSignal.login(userId)` makes the profile id the subscription's
 * `external_id`, which is what the server targets (lib/notifications/onesignal.ts).
 * That is also what makes it multi-device: a vendor's counter tablet and phone
 * both receive, instead of whichever registered last overwriting
 * `profiles.onesignal_id`. The player id is still saved as a fallback.
 *
 * `userId={null}` (signed out): if this browser was logged in to OneSignal
 * before, log it out, so the next person on a shared phone does not receive the
 * last person's orders. Signing out is a full page load (/auth/signout), so this
 * runs on the first page after it. A browser that never subscribed loads nothing.
 *
 * Renders nothing and does nothing unless NEXT_PUBLIC_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID is set.
 *
 * Inside the Android app shells (mobile/) push is native: see src/lib/native/bridge.ts.
