 *
 * Those two used to read the module constants in `pricing.ts` instead. Checkout
 * and `createOrder` already read `platform_settings`, so an admin who changed
 * the delivery fee or set a free-delivery threshold got a cart that advertised
 * one number and a bill that charged another — the exact divergence `pricing.ts`
 * was written to end, surviving one layer above it.
 *
 * Provided once in the customer layout, which is `force-dynamic` and reads the
 * settings row server-side, so the first paint is already correct — no flash of
 * a default fee, and no client fetch.
