/**
 * The framework's own hooks into this app's lifecycle.
 *
 * Next calls `register()` once per server instance before it serves anything,
 * and `onRequestError` whenever it catches a throw — from a Server Component,
 * a Route Handler, a Server Action or the proxy. That last one is the important
 * one: it is the only place that sees ALL of those without every one of them
 * being wrapped by hand, and it is handed `routePath` and `routeType` by the
 * framework, which is better attribution than anything we could reconstruct.
 *
 * Verified against `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/
 * 03-file-conventions/instrumentation.md` — `onRequestError` is stable from
 * Next 15 and this project is on 16.3.0.
 *
 * Imports are dynamic throughout. This file is loaded in both the Node and the
 * Edge runtime, and `lib/obs/emit.ts` pulls in the Supabase admin client and
 * `server-only`; importing that at module scope would evaluate it in every
 * runtime on every boot, including ones that will never write an event.
 */

/**
 * Runs once per server instance, before the first request.
 *
 * Its whole job is the deploy marker. Without one, "errors started at 10:42"
 * has nothing to sit next to and the release-correlation panel is blank —
 * which, on a platform with no CI and no deploy log, means there is no record
 * anywhere of when a version went out.
 *
 * The insert is an upsert on (release, env), so the second and third instances
 * to cold-start on the same release do not each write a row and turn one deploy
 * into a cluster of markers.
