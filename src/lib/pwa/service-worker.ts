 * Service-worker registration and update lifecycle.

 * The worker itself is `/OneSignalSDKWorker.js` — see that file for why the app
 * shares OneSignal's registration instead of taking one of its own. Registering
 * it here rather than leaving it to the OneSignal SDK matters: the SDK only
 * loads on the customer shell, and only for a signed-in profile, so vendors,
 * riders and admins had no worker at all — exactly the people most likely to be
 * on a weak connection in a kitchen or on a road.
 *
 * Everything degrades to a no-op: no `serviceWorker` in navigator (Firefox
 * private windows, older iOS), an insecure origin, or a failed registration all
 * leave the app working exactly as it does today.
