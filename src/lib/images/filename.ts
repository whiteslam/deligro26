/**
 * Reading a folder of photos as dish names.
 *
 * The library's whole value is that a photo is named the way a menu writes the
 * dish — the matcher in `./match` has nothing else to go on. So when an admin
 * drops a folder in, the filename IS the name, and this module is where that
 * translation happens: `chicken-biryani_02.jpg` → "Chicken Biryani", and the
 * folders it sat in become alternate names.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 *  - It does not invent a name for `IMG_2043.jpg`. A camera filename carries no
 *    dish in it, and a library full of "Img 2043" is worse than one photo
 *    short: it can never be matched, and it collides with the next camera dump.
 *    `looksUnnamed()` flags those so the UI asks a person.
 *  - It does not guess veg/non-veg. That is `vegFromTokens`' job, run on the
 *    server over the same keywords the matcher compares, so a bulk upload and a
 *    single one can never disagree.
 *
 * Pure and client-safe — the review list scores names as you edit them.
