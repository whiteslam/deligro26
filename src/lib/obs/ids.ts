/**
 * Correlation ids, and the environment stamp every event carries.
 *
 * ## Two ids, because they answer two questions
 *
 *   * **`requestId`** — one HTTP request. Answers "what else happened while
 *     this call was being served".
 *   * **`traceId`** — one logical operation, which on this platform spans
 *     several requests and one inbound webhook: checkout → create Razorpay
 *     order → Razorpay redirect → webhook → settle → dispatch → push. Answers
 *     "show me this order's whole journey through the system".
 *
 * A single id cannot do both. Collapsing them would either break the trace at
 * every hop or make "this request" unqueryable.
 *
 * ## Where the trace survives the webhook
 *
 * Razorpay will not carry our header. The webhook leg rejoins its trace through
 * `payments.provider_order_id`, which the app already stores when it creates
 * the payment — so the join is a real column, not a guess. See
 * `docs/OBSERVABILITY_PLAN.md` §5.
 *
 * Runtime-agnostic on purpose: `proxy.ts` mints ids in the Edge runtime and the
 * route handlers read them in Node, so nothing here may import `node:crypto`.
 * `globalThis.crypto.getRandomValues` exists in both.
