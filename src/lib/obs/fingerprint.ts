/**
 * Turning a thousand identical failures into one issue.

 * them as two lines and an issue tracker must show them as one row with a count
 * of two. Everything else here is plumbing around that idea.
 *
 * Pure, sync, and free of `server-only` and of any `node:` import, for three
 * reasons: `scripts/qa/obs-telemetry.ts` asserts against it directly;
 * `instrumentation.ts` may run in the Edge runtime, where `node:crypto` is not
 * available; and a fingerprint that could differ between two runtimes would
 * split one issue in half, which is precisely the failure this file exists to

/**
 * A 64-bit hash built from two independent 32-bit FNV-1a passes.
 *
 * Not a cryptographic hash and does not need to be: nothing here is a secret,
 * and the only property required is that the same input always produces the
 * same 16 hex characters. Over 64 bits, a platform carrying even ten thousand
 * distinct issues has a collision probability around 3 in 10^12 — far below the
 * rate at which `normaliseMessage` will merge two genuinely different bugs,
 * which is the real accuracy limit here.
 *
 * Two 32-bit passes rather than one 64-bit BigInt pass, and `Math.imul` rather
 * than `*`: this project targets ES2017 (tsconfig), where BigInt literals are
 * unavailable, and `Math.imul` is the only way to get a wrapping 32-bit
 * multiply out of a JS number. The second pass walks the string backwards from
 * a different basis, so the two halves respond differently to the same input.
 *
 * Also why this is not `node:crypto` — `instrumentation.ts` may run in the Edge
 * runtime, and a fingerprint that differed between runtimes would split one
 * issue in two, which is exactly the failure this file exists to prevent.
