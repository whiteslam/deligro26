/**
 * The one place telemetry is stripped of things it must never carry.
 *
 * ## Why this runs at write, not at display
 *
 * A redaction applied when the console renders a row is a redaction that has
 * already failed: the secret is in the database, in its indexes, in every
 * backup, and in the next PostgREST query anyone writes. `emit()` calls this
 * BEFORE it builds the row, so there is no code path — no "internal" helper, no
 * future debug flag — that reaches `obs_events` unredacted. Same shape as the
 * project's other security rules: enforce at the boundary that cannot be
 * bypassed, not at the surface that happens to be looking.
 *
 * ## Why `attrs` is an allowlist
 *
 * A deny-list is a promise to remember every sensitive field anyone will ever
 * add. It fails on the first one nobody thought of — which, in this codebase,
 * would be something like `vendorLoginPassword` (migration 0039 stores exactly
 * that, on purpose, in a table with no policies). Only named keys survive here,
 * so a new field is invisible to telemetry until someone decides otherwise.
 * That is the same default the `restaurants` column grant uses: a new column is
 * invisible until granted on purpose.
 *
 * ## What is not captured at all
 *
 * Request bodies, response bodies and IP addresses have no field on `ObsEvent`
 * and no branch here. They are not truncated or hashed — they are not
 * collected. Everything the investigation actually needs (method, templated
 * route, status, latency, actor role, order id) is present without them.
 *
 * Pure and free of `server-only` on purpose, so `scripts/qa/obs-telemetry.ts`
 * can assert against it directly. A redaction rule that is only claimed in a
 * comment is exactly the stale security doc AGENTS.md warns about.

 * and hit the same rule. Matching the raw string missed `x-api-key`, which is
 * exactly the shape a header-derived field arrives in; enumerating spellings
