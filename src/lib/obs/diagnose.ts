/**
 * "Possible root cause" and "what should I do", without inventing either.
 *
 * ## The rule this file exists to obey
 *
 * An observability tool that writes a confident narrative is wrong often
 * enough to be overruled once — and after that nobody reads it again, including
 * on the day it happens to be right. So nothing here composes a story. It
 * checks a fixed set of relations, reports each as a labelled claim with the
 * evidence that supports it, and says **Unknown** when nothing matches.
 *
 * Four confidence levels, and the distinction between them is not decorative:
 *
 *   * **Confirmed** — the evidence *is* the cause. Only used where the failure
 *     names its own reason: a missing migration, a rejected signature.
 *   * **Likely** — a strong, specific correlation with a known mechanism.
 *   * **Possible** — a correlation with a plausible mechanism and alternatives.
 *   * **Unknown** — nothing matched. Shown as a checklist, not as a shrug.
 *
 * ## Why it is a lookup and not a model
 *
 * The failures this platform has are enumerable — there are about fifteen of
 * them, listed in `docs/OBSERVABILITY_PLAN.md` §4 — and each has a known first
 * move. A table of those is more useful than a generated paragraph, is
 * reviewable in a diff, and cannot hallucinate a subsystem that does not exist.
 * Where the table has nothing, it says so.
 *
 * Pure and free of `server-only`, so the QA suite can assert the table.
