 * The telemetry vocabulary, in one place.
 *
 * Deliberately free of `server-only` and of any I/O: everything here is a type

 * against the same names the server uses. Same reasoning as
 * `lib/releases/app-version.ts` — the rules worth testing should not be locked
 * inside a module that needs a database to load.
 *
 * These strings are mirrored by CHECK constraints in migration 0046. Changing
 * one here without changing the migration produces a runtime insert failure,
 * not a type error, so keep the two together.
