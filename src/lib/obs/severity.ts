/**
 * How bad is this, on first sight.
 *
 * Two different questions get answered in two different places, and conflating
 * them is how monitoring systems end up either screaming or silent:
 *
 *   * **Here** — what a SINGLE event is worth, knowing nothing about rate. This
 *     is a lookup, deliberately: it must be readable, reviewable and the same
 *     every time, because it decides what shows up red in the issue list.
 *   * **`obs_evaluate_alerts` (migration 0046)** — whether a RATE has crossed a
 *     line. Only the database can answer that; it needs a window, a sample
 *     floor and history.
 *
 * So "one push failed" is medium here and never pages anyone, while "a quarter
 * of pushes are failing" is an alert rule. Neither can be expressed as the
 * other.
 *
 * An operator's manual severity always wins and is never recomputed — enforced
 * in SQL by the `severity_source = 'manual'` branch in `obs_ingest`, so it
 * holds even for a caller that bypasses this module.
 *
 * Pure and free of `server-only` so the QA suite can assert the table directly.
