/**
 * The write side of observability.
 *
 * ## Three rules this module may never break
 *
 * 1. **It never throws into its caller.** Every public function here is
 *    wrapped. An order must not fail to be placed because the telemetry about
 *    placing it could not be written — that would make the monitoring a new and
 *    worse outage than the one it was installed to find. Every failure path
 *    below ends in a swallow.
 *
 * 2. **It never adds latency to a response.** Writes are handed to Next's
 *    `after()`, which runs them once the response has been flushed
 *    (`node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/04-functions/after.md`).
 *    The customer waiting for their basket to become an order does not wait for
 *    a log row.
 *
 * 3. **It redacts before it builds the row.** `redact()` runs here, not in the
 *    console, so there is no path — including a future "debug mode" — that puts
 *    an unredacted string in the database. See `redact.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why the service-role client
 *
 * The `obs_*` tables have RLS on with no policies and every privilege revoked
 * from `anon` and `authenticated` (migration 0046). That is the containment the
 * project already uses for `rate_limits` and `vendor_login_credentials`, and it
 * means the only way in is the service role. Per AGENTS.md rule 5 this needs an
 * authorization check above it in the same path — and it has one, of an unusual
 * shape: this path only ever WRITES, and it writes a fixed row built from
 * already-redacted values. There is no user input that can steer it at a row it
 * should not touch, and nothing it can read back. The reading side, which is
 * where authorization actually matters, lives in `read.ts` behind
 * `requireRole("admin")`.
