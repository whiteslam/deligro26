/**
 * The browser half of error reporting.
 *
 * Runs in the client bundle, so it is deliberately tiny and has no imports: it
 * ships to every visitor on every page, and an observability tool that costs a
 * customer 30KB on a 3G connection has made the product worse in order to watch
 * it.
 *
 * What it does NOT do, on purpose:
 *
 *   * No batching, no queue, no retry. `sendBeacon` already survives the page
 *     being closed, which is the case that matters — a crash is often the last
 *     thing a page does.
 *   * No breadcrumbs, no session replay, no user identification. The server
 *     takes the actor from the session cookie; the browser is not asked and is
 *     not believed.
 *   * No context beyond the path and the stack. Everything else the endpoint
 *     would need is either derivable server-side or not worth the bytes.
 *
 * Stacks are minified — there is no source-map upload, because there is no
 * Sentry (see the decision log in `docs/OBSERVABILITY_PLAN.md` §12). That is a
 * real limit: these group and count reliably, and they locate only sometimes.

 * whole rate limit in under a second — after which nothing else that page did
 * wrong could be reported at all.
