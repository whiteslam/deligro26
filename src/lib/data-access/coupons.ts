/**
 * Coupon *pricing* — the preview half of the feature.
 *
 * This says what a code would be worth. It does not apply anything, and
 * nothing it returns is billed. The authority is `apply_coupon_to_order()`
 * (0031, rewritten in 0041), which re-derives the amount from the order's own
 * `order_items` inside one transaction that also records the redemption.
 *
 * Since 0041 this file no longer computes anything. It used to re-implement
 * the percentage-and-ceiling arithmetic in TypeScript alongside the copy in
 * SQL, and the two had already drifted — the TS side never checked
 * `max_redemptions`, and could not check the restaurant because nothing told
 * it which one. Both now call `price_coupon()`; this is a thin caller of the
 * `preview_coupon()` RPC that wraps it.
 *
 * That also closed a hole. Reading `coupons` directly meant the table had to
 * be SELECT-able by the session, and the 0006 policy handed every active code
 * to anyone who asked — anon included — which made the route's session
 * requirement and 20/minute rate limit decorative. The RPC answers about one
 * code the caller already named, and the table is no longer readable.
 *
 * Two callers, deliberately:
 *   * `/api/coupons/validate` — the checkout's "apply code" button.
 *   * `createOrder()` — a last check before anything is written, because an
 *     order cannot be rolled back once it exists.
