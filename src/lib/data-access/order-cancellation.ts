 * Writing a cancellation, on a database that may not have 0051 yet.
 *
 * Three paths cancel an order — the customer's route, the kitchen board and the
 * admin console — and all three now have something to say about who did it and
 * why. One place to say it, so the three cannot drift into recording the same
 * event three different ways, and one place to degrade when the migration has
 * not landed: a cancellation must still succeed on an un-migrated database, it
 * just goes back to being anonymous.
 *
 * What `cancelled_by` is worth is covered in the migration. In short: the
 * trigger derives it from whoever is actually making the write and ignores what
 * a client sends, EXCEPT for service_role — our own server code — which is the
 * only caller that can know a customer-initiated cancel arrived through an
 * admin client. So `actor` is meaningful from a service-role writer and is
 * simply redundant from anyone else.
