/**
 * Admin all-orders feed, and the single-order view an operator opens when a

 *
 * Admins may see every order (is_admin() in the RLS policies); we use the
 * service-role client here so the customer / restaurant / items joins come back
 * in one query. The caller MUST already be role-gated to admin — the /admin
 * layout's `requireRole("admin")` runs before any page under it renders, and
 * every export below is reachable only from those pages. That gate is the
 * authorization for the createAdminClient() calls in this file (AGENTS.md §5).
 *
 * What this file used to hide, and no longer does:
 *
 *   * `ready` was mapped to "KITCHEN", so an operator could not tell a kitchen
 *     still cooking from one whose food had been sitting on the pass waiting for
 *     a rider — the exact window where an order goes wrong.
 *   * how an order was paid was not read at all. An online order that never
 *     settled is invisible to the kitchen by design (see vendor-orders.ts), so
 *     the admin is the only person who can see that it is stuck.
 *   * nothing computed lateness, because until 0026 nothing recorded when the
 *     kitchen accepted an order or when the food was ready.

   `platform_settings.default_prep_minutes`, and 0026's lifecycle stamps. This
   answers the operator's much smaller one: "how far past the promise is this
   order, right now". The two arrived in the same release from opposite ends and
   SHOULD be one module: once both have landed, fold this into eta.ts and have
