/**
 * The refund queue, for real.
 *
 * The admin refunds screen used to render three invented refunds, and its
 * Approve button only set local React state — it rendered "Approved · logged"
 * and nothing was approved, and nothing was logged. An admin could believe they
 * had settled a customer's ₹660 and be wrong.
 *
 * Two things were still missing after that was fixed, and this file now carries
 * both:
 *
 *   1. Nothing ever WROTE to `refunds`. The table has existed since 0001 with no
 *      request path and no automatic refund, so the queue an admin was asked to
 *      work could only ever be empty. `queueRefundForOrder` (cancellations, a
 *      vendor declining) and `requestRefund` (the customer asking) fill it.
 *   2. Approving returned no money. Now that an order can actually be paid
 *      (0025), approving a refund on an order paid online calls Razorpay and
 *      records what the gateway said — and if the gateway refuses, the request
 *      stays pending rather than being marked settled. A refund the app claims
 *      to have made and hasn't is worse than one it never offered.
 *
 * The status vocabulary is the database's: `refund_status` is
 * ('pending','approved','denied'). This file used to say 'rejected', which no
 * Postgres enum has ever accepted — every deny failed at the database while the
 * UI reported the decision as recorded.
 *
 * Decision writes go through RLS ("refunds — admin decide", 0001), so a non-admin
 * cannot decide a refund even if this code were called from the wrong place.

 * Idempotent. 0026 adds a unique partial index allowing one pending refund per
 * order; a second call loses the race with a 23505 and reports queued:false,
 * which is the truth — this call queued nothing, because a request is already
