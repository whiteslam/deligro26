 * calculation (promise time from the restaurant's eta window plus the accepted
 * / ready stamps added in 0026), and a second implementation on the dashboard
 * is how two screens end up disagreeing about whether an order is late. This
 * module takes that feed and answers the two things the board adds: who is
 * carrying the order, and how many have nobody carrying them.
 *
 * Service-role, and therefore past RLS: authorized by the /admin layout's
 * `requireRole("admin")`, which runs before any caller renders (AGENTS.md §5).
