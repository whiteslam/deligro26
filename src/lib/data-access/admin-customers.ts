 * list of people who have joined — ordered newest first, so a fresh
 * registration surfaces at the top with a "New" tag.
 *
 * Service-role client: an admin may read every profile (is_admin() in the RLS
 * policies), and we fold the per-customer order count into the same query. The
 * caller MUST already be admin-gated — the /admin layout's requireRole runs
 * before this does, and that gate is the authorization for the
 * createAdminClient() calls here (AGENTS.md §5).
 *
 * This is real customer PII on an operator's screen, so it is scoped to what a
 * support call actually needs: who they are, how to reach them, what they have
 * ordered, and what they have spent. Nothing here writes.
