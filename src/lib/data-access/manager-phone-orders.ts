/**
 * Phone-in orders — the job the manager role was created for.
 *
 * Someone rings the shop instead of using the app; an operator takes the order
 * and puts it into the same pipeline as every other one. From the kitchen's
 * side and the rider's side there is nothing special about it, which is the
 * point: a phone order is an order, not a parallel system.
 *
 * ## Why the write is a service-role call
 *
 * Migration 0023 gave a manager read-and-advance on `orders` and withheld
 * INSERT on purpose, saying so in its header. That still holds. An INSERT
 * policy is a privilege the role carries everywhere — including into a raw
 * PostgREST call whose body a manager writes themselves, with any customer_id,
 * any total and no attribution. What a phone order actually needs is much
 * narrower: one function that computes the money from the database's own
 * prices, pins the customer to the number that rang, and stamps who took the
 * call. That is a code path, not a privilege, so it is built as one.
 *
 * The bargain that makes it safe is `placed_by` (migration 0029). Every row
 * this file writes says which operator wrote it, the column is locked against
 * every later update, and the path refuses to run at all on a database that
 * cannot record it. An unattributable order in someone else's name is the exact
 * thing being guarded against, so producing one is not an acceptable
 * degradation — see `assertProvenance()`.
 *
 * Reads are ordinary RLS reads through the manager's own JWT. The catalog is
 * public, `profiles` is granted to managers by 0023, and routing either through
 * the service role would convert a deliberate limit into no limit.
