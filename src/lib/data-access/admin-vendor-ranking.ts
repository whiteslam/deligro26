/**
 * How shops actually perform, so the featured slots can be argued about with
 * numbers instead of instinct.
 *
 * The slots board's whole job is "which ten shops go at the top of the feed",
 * and until now it answered that with a name and a search box — nothing on the
 * screen said whether the shop in #1 sells more than the one in #7. This module
 * supplies the two signals an operator actually reasons with:
 *
 *   * sales  — gross value of delivered orders over a rolling window
 *   * rating — the catalogue rating customers see on the card
 *
 * Admins may read every order (is_admin() in the RLS policies); the service-role
 * client is used here so one query covers the whole catalogue rather than one
 * per shop. The caller MUST already be role-gated to admin — /admin's layout runs
 * `requireRole("admin")` before any page under it renders, and every export below
 * is reachable only from those pages. That gate is the authorization for the
 * createAdminClient() call (AGENTS.md §5).
 *
 * Reads degrade, writes fail loudly: a broken orders query returns a board with
 * zeroes rather than taking the slots screen down, but an auto-fill the operator
 * asked for throws so the action can say it didn't happen.

/**
 * Hard ceiling on the order rows pulled for aggregation. PostgREST cannot GROUP
 * BY, so the window is summed in JS; this stops a busy month from pulling an
 * unbounded result set. When it bites, `truncated` says so and the UI repeats it
 * rather than presenting a partial sum as the total.
