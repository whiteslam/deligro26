/**
 * What has actually happened to this customer's orders, as a feed.
 *
 * The bell in the header pointed at a settings screen — two rows of text and a
 * permission switch — because there was nothing else for it to point at. Push
 * notifications are sent through OneSignal and nothing about them is stored: no
 * table, no history, no read state. A customer who missed the "your rider is on
 * the way" banner had no way to see it again.
 *
 * This does not invent that table. The events a customer was pushed about are
 * the same events the order lifecycle already timestamps — `created_at` when
 * they ordered, `accepted_at` when the kitchen took it, `ready_at` when it was
 * packed, `cancelled_at` when it stopped (all `orders`, migration 0026) — so the
 * feed is derived from facts the database already holds rather than from a log
 * nobody is writing. It is therefore honest by construction: nothing can appear
 * here that did not happen, and nothing can go missing because a push failed.
 *
 * The cost of deriving rather than logging: no read state, and no entry for a
 * notification that was not a lifecycle change. Both are worth it until there
 * is a reason to write rows.
