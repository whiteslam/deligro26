 * accepted from any address at any distance, at the flat delivery fee, and a
 * rider was dispatched on a trip whose economics had never been checked.

 * permissive at the boundary (the road is always at least as long as the crow
 * flies), which is the right direction for a gate that can refuse someone's
 * dinner: it only ever rejects addresses that are out of range by any measure.

/**
 * The answer. Measured from the CITY CENTRE, and it still fails closed.
 *
 * It used to measure from the shop and refuse every order from an unpinned
 * shop once a radius was set — correct for a per-shop radius (a Durg shop took
 * a 70 km order that way), and the reason most shops could not take orders at
 * all while 68 of 70 were unpinned. With one city circle the question is
 * "is this address in Bemetara's delivery area?", which needs no shop pin.
 *
 * What still refuses:
 *   - an address with no pin, at any radius (`unverifiable`, `address_unpinned`):
 *     nobody can deliver to it;
 *   - an address outside the circle (`out_of_range`);
 *   - a shop that IS pinned outside the circle (`out_of_range`,
 *     `shop_outside_area`) — the one piece of the old per-shop rule worth
 *     keeping, so a shop onboarded outside the city cannot take town orders.
 *
 * An unpinned shop is taken to be in town: shops are onboarded by hand, in
 * Bemetara. Radius 0 is still the admin switching the limit off (`unlimited`).
