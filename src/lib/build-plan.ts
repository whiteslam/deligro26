/**
 * Build plan + live delivery tracker — single source of truth for `/build`.
 *
 * The original plan was a 5-week (~35 day) run from "static UI + partial
 * backend" to a shippable v1. That window closed on 2026-08-06 with payments
 * and the production deploy still open, and with a second body of work — vendor
 * management, the manager role, storefront depth, the first security audit —
 * shipped alongside it. Both are recorded here: the original weeks keep their
 * numbering, and the work that landed outside the plan is filed under its own
 * later milestone rather than backdated into a week it did not belong to.
 *
 * Update `status` as tasks land; the tracker route renders straight from this
 * file, so the page is always in sync with reality. A task marked "done" must
 * actually work end to end — if it half-works, say so in `detail` and leave it
 * "active". A stale tracker is worse than none (see AGENTS.md).
 *
 * status: "done" | "active" | "todo" | "blocked"
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Verified against the code on 2026-08-13. That pass was worth doing: this file
 * had drifted in *both* directions, which is the part worth remembering.
 *
 *   * Work shipped and never ticked off — the manager board and rider dispatch
 *     (slice E), and the refund deny path, which this file still described as
 *     broken long after it was fixed. Reading it, you would have rebuilt three
 *     things that already worked.
 *   * Work described more kindly than it was — "coupons: half-wired" when in
 *     fact nothing in the app had ever called the endpoint, so there was no
 *     wiring at all; "pickup OTP: no UI" when the rider's half shipped and only
 *     the kitchen's check is missing.
 *   * A decision filed as debt — a nonce-based CSP sat here as a `todo` while
 *     its own `detail` said it was an accepted risk. It now lives only in
 *     docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md, where accepted risks belong.
 *
 * Neither direction is harmless: the first wastes a rebuild, the second hides
 * a gap, the third inflates what is left. When you change a status, check the
 * code rather than your memory of it — and when a `detail` states a fact about
 * the codebase ("no UI", "the deny path fails"), that is a claim with a shelf
 * life, so re-read it before trusting it.
