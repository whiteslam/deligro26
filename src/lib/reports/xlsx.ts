/**
 * One branded workbook builder for every table the console exports.
 *
 * Written once rather than per screen because an exported sheet leaves the
 * building: it goes to an accountant, a vendor, or into somebody's records, and
 * three screens each rolling their own header is how you end up with three
 * different-looking documents all claiming to be from the same company.
 *
 * **What "branded" can and cannot mean here.** SheetJS's community build — the
 * one this project carries, pinned to the CDN tarball because the npm channel
 * is abandoned (see docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md, H-3) — writes values, column widths
 * and merges, but it silently drops cell styles: no bold, no fills, no logo.
 * So the badging is the masthead block, the document title, the period it
 * covers and the generated-at stamp, laid out in merged cells at the top of
 * every sheet. That is real, checkable provenance on the page. Anything
 * promising colour would need SheetJS Pro or a different writer, and quietly
 * shipping an unstyled sheet that the code claims is styled is worse than
 * saying so here.
 *
 * Numbers are written as numbers, never as pre-formatted "₹1,234" strings —
 * a currency string in a spreadsheet is a value nobody can sum, which defeats
 * the reason the export exists.
