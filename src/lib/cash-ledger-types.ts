/**
 * Types and display labels for the cash-on-delivery handover chain and

 * they live here rather than in the server-only data-access files that read
 * and write the tables. src/lib/data-access/cod-handovers.ts and
 * operational-expenses.ts re-export from here for a server caller's
 * convenience.
