/**
 * Who should go and get this order.
 *
 * The rule, in the order the operators asked for it:
 *
 *   1. A rider who is not in the middle of a delivery. Someone already carrying
 *      dinner is not the right person to send to a second kitchen, however
 *      close they happen to be. An outstanding offer counts as being in the
 *      middle of one — otherwise three vendors accepting inside a minute would
 *      each be handed the same idle rider, and two of those orders would sit
 *      held for somebody already riding to the first shop.
 *   2. Among those, whoever is nearest the shop.
 *   3. If every rider is committed, fall back to the least-loaded, and among
 *      equals, whoever is nearest the shop — they will be free soonest and with
 *      the shortest ride to the pickup.
 *
 * Proximity is measured from the last position the rider's device actually
 * reported (`deliveries.driver_lat/lng`, written by `reportDriverLocation`). A
 * fix older than MAX_FIX_AGE_MS is treated as no fix at all rather than as a
 * confident location — a rider who denied the location permission this morning
 * must not be dispatched across town on the strength of where they were at 9am.
 * Riders with no usable fix sort last, so a known-near rider always wins, and
 * they still get picked when nobody has a position (which is the state of a
 * fleet where nobody has granted location yet).
 *
 * ## The offer is a first refusal, not an assignment
 *
 * Dispatch writes `deliveries.offered_driver_id` (migration 0042) and leaves
 * `driver_id` null. For EXCLUSIVE_OFFER_MS after the offer, the order is hidden
 * from every other rider's board and `acceptDelivery` refuses anyone else; after
 * that it opens to the whole pool. Nobody is ever *stuck* with an order they
 * didn't accept, and no order is ever stranded because the one rider we picked
 * had their phone in their pocket.
 *
 * Every function here is best-effort and swallows its own failures: dispatch
 * runs off the back of a vendor accepting an order, and a dispatch outage must
 * never roll back a transition the kitchen has already made. The worst case is
 * the behaviour this platform had before the module existed — the order lands
 * in the open pool at `ready` and the fastest thumb wins.
 */

/**
 * How long the chosen rider gets the order to themselves.
 *
 * Three minutes: long enough that a rider mid-ride can look at their phone at
 * the next light, short enough that an ignored offer costs an order far less
 * than the eight minutes at which the admin board starts calling it a dispatch
 * failure (UNASSIGNED_AFTER_MIN in admin-dispatch.ts).
