 *
 *   ONESIGNAL_APP_ID          — public app id (also exposed to the client SDK)
 *   ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY    — SECRET. Server only. Never NEXT_PUBLIC_.
 *
 * If either is unset the sender is a silent no-op, so dev/demo and the build
 * work without credentials (mirrors the Supabase "demo mode" guard).
