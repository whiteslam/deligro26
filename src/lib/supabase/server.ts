/**
 * An anon client that touches no cookies — for reads that are genuinely public

 *
 * Two reasons this exists rather than reusing `createClient()` above.
 *
 * 1. **It can prerender.** `cookies()` opts a route out of static generation
 *    entirely, so `sitemap.xml` could not be built ahead of time and threw
 *    `DynamicServerError` during `next build` — the catalog read failed and the
 *    sitemap silently shipped with no restaurants in it.
 * 2. **It is the correct authority.** A sitemap should list what an anonymous
 *    crawler can see, not what the requesting session can see. Binding it to a
 *    session would mean the file's contents depended on who fetched it, which
 *    for a sitemap is meaningless at best.
 *
 * Still the anon key, so RLS applies exactly as it does for a logged-out
 * visitor. This is NOT `createAdminClient()` and grants nothing extra —
 * a table anon cannot read stays unreadable here.
