 * The version gate for the two Android apps.

 * Both apps are built outside this repo and installed from a direct `.apk`, so
 * there is no store to notice a bad build and no store to update from. This
 * module is the whole mechanism: an app reports the `versionCode` it is running
 * and gets back whether a newer one exists, whether the one it is on is still
 * allowed, and where the file is.
 *
 * Deliberately pure and free of `server-only` — it does no I/O, reads nothing
 * from the environment and is exercised directly by `scripts/qa/app-version.ts`.
 * The route (`/api/app-version`) is the thin part: read settings, call this.

 * straight to PostgREST by an admin, would otherwise be served as-is.
 *
 * An empty string is a valid answer — it means "no link to offer", which is
 * what a fresh 0043 row holds. `updateAvailable` still travels, so an app can
 * say "an update exists, ask the office" rather than nothing at all.
