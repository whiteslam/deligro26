/**
 * Which storefront categories are actually on offer.
 *
 * `platform_settings.feature_grocery` / `feature_pick_drop` are editable in the
 * admin Settings tab, validated, clamped and written to the database — and were
 * read by no customer-facing code at all. An admin switching Groceries off to
 * handle a supplier outage got a "Saved" confirmation and a storefront where the
 * category tile, the grocery hero and its WhatsApp CTA all carried on taking
 * orders. This is the consumer that was missing.
 *
 * Pure, and shared by the category strip and the Stores page, so a category
 * cannot be hidden from one and reachable from the other — a tile that is gone
 * but whose `?category=` link still works is the same bug wearing a hat.
 *
 * ## feature_pharmacy
 *
 * There is no pharmacy category, hero or vertical in the product, so it gates
 * no category here. It does gate BANNERS (below): a "Medicines at your door"
 * campaign pointed customers at a service that does not exist. The toggle is
 * not on the Settings form; the column defaults off and is flipped in the
 * database the day a pharmacy vertical ships.
