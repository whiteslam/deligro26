/**
 * When the food actually arrives — and whether we are already past it.
 *
 * This module decides what a customer believes, so it is written to be boring:
 * pure, synchronous, no I/O, no clock except the one you hand it. Everything it
 * knows arrives as arguments, which is also what makes it safe to run on the
 * server for the first paint and on the client between polls and get the same
 * answer.
 *
 * What it replaces: `etaMinutes = restaurant.eta_min ?? 25`. A per-restaurant
 * constant, chosen at checkout, still on the screen at the door. It could not
 * count down, it could not slip, and it could not admit that an order had been
 * sitting on the pass for twenty minutes waiting for a rider. Meanwhile
 * `platform_settings.default_prep_minutes` — the one number an admin can
 * actually tune — was read by nothing at all.
 *
 * The model, in one paragraph. A restaurant advertises a band (eta_min–eta_max)
 * measured door to door. Split that promise into a kitchen leg and a road leg:
 * the kitchen leg is the admin's `defaultPrepMinutes`, the road leg is whatever
 * the band has left over. Each stage of the order then re-anchors the estimate
 * on the leg that is genuinely still ahead — which is the whole reason the
 * number moves. `placed` still owes prep + road; `kitchen` owes the rest of prep
 * plus road, measured from the moment the kitchen accepted (0026's
 * `accepted_at`); `ready` owes only the road, and owes it from *now*, because
 * nobody has picked it up yet; `on_the_way` owes the road from the moment it
 * left. An estimate is never allowed to be earlier than the checkout promise —
 * we do not talk a customer's expectations up — and never earlier than what is
 * physically still possible, which is what makes lateness fall out for free
 * instead of being a separate guess.
