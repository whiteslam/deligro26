/**
 * Razorpay — giving money back.
 *
 * Kept beside `razorpay.ts` rather than inside it because the two directions are
 * not the same risk. Taking money that never arrives is a bug the customer
 * reports; returning money twice is a loss nobody reports, and the only thing
 * standing between the two is being precise about what the gateway actually
 * confirmed. So this module refuses to round anything up: it reports a refund as
 * settled only when Razorpay says `processed`, and it throws rather than return
 * a half-answer.
 *
 * Same shape as `razorpay.ts`: server-only, no SDK, fails closed when
 * unconfigured, and every failure is a `RazorpayError` carrying the status the
 * caller should surface.
 *
 * `isRazorpayConfigured` is imported, not recomputed — there must be exactly one
 * answer to "can we talk to Razorpay at all", or the refund path could believe
 * the gateway is reachable while checkout is showing "Available soon". The key
 * pair itself is read again here only because `razorpay.ts` keeps `authHeader()`
 * private and exports no way to reach it; widening that module's surface is not
 * this change's to make. Same variables, same precedence, same fallback.
