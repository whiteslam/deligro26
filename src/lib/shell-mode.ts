/**
 * Which shell a portal is being viewed in — the one concept, in one place.
 *
 * Admin and vendor both run two top-level shells: the ops console (desktop) and
 * the phone frame (a handset, or a preview of one on a desktop). Everything
 * about *which* is on screen lives here so the server, the client and the CSS
 * cannot disagree.
 *
 * The preference is carried in a **cookie**, not localStorage. That is the
 * whole point: only a cookie reaches the server, and the server is where the
 * decision has to be made. When it was client-only, `admin/layout.tsx` had no
 * way to know, so every console page server-rendered as the 402px phone frame —
 * iPhone bezel, Dynamic Island and all — and swapped to the console a paint
 * later. The web admin was, briefly but literally, the phone app.
 *
 * This module is safe on both sides of the boundary. The server-only resolver
 * lives in `shell-mode.server.ts`.
