/**
 * What an order costs. One definition, used by the basket, the checkout, the
 * listing cards, and the server that actually bills.
 *
 * These numbers used to be copy-pasted into four files — and the copy that
 * looked canonical (the cart store) was read by nobody, so changing it did
 * nothing while the customer was quietly shown three different delivery fees for
 * the same order. Anything that needs a fee or a tax imports it from here.
 *
 * The constants below are *defaults*, not the live numbers: once an admin saves
 * the Settings tab, `platform_settings` is the source and these are only what a
 * demo install or an un-migrated database falls back to (see
 * `settings-defaults.ts`). So anything that quotes a price to a customer takes a
 * config — `computeChargesWith`, `riderPayout` — and gets it from the settings
 * row. `computeCharges()` is the defaults, and is for callers that genuinely
 * have no settings in scope; a customer-facing surface is not one of those.
 *
 * Safe on the client (no secrets), but the server is still the authority: the
 * amount billed is recomputed here in `createOrder` from the settings it reads
 * itself, never taken from what the browser sends.
