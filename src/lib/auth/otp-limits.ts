/**
 * How many OTPs one number may ask for, and when it may ask again.
 *
 * Pure — no Supabase, no clock of its own — so `createOtp` feeds it the send
 * times it read from `otp_codes`, and `scripts/qa/otp-limits.ts` feeds it made-up
 * ones. Every send is a paid SMS, so these caps are a cost control as much as an
 * abuse control.
 *
 * Every refusal carries the exact number of seconds until the next send would
 * be allowed. The login screen turns that into "try again after 4:30 PM"; a flat
 * "try later" is what had people pressing Resend over and over.
