/**
 * The portal registry — one entry per surface that has its own front door.
 *
 * Deligro used to have a single global /login that read your role and threw you
 * wherever that role belonged. That made one account's role decide which app you
 * got: the owner's phone is an admin, so signing in to *shop* landed on the
 * admin console. Each portal now has its own sign-in page instead, and the
 * customer app is simply what you get at `/`.
 *
 *   /admin   → /admin/login    (email or mobile + password, or phone OTP)
 *   /vendor  → /vendor/login   (email or mobile + password, or phone OTP)
 *   /manager → /manager/login  (email or mobile + password, or phone OTP)
 *   /driver  → /driver/login   (email or mobile + password, or phone OTP)
 *   customer → /login          (phone OTP, or browse as guest)
 *
 * The same account may hold more than one of these — signing in at a door does
 * not change who you are, only where you land. Moving *between* the surfaces one
 * account holds is `surfaces.ts` + the `/switch` chooser; it navigates, it does
 * not grant.
 *
 * `roles` here is for *routing* — which front door leads where, and whether a
 * signed-in visitor should be sent straight in. It is not the security boundary:
 * every portal layout still calls `requireRole()` / `requireVendorAccess()`
 * server-side, and the database still enforces RLS underneath that.
 *
 * Pure and side-effect free (the `Role` import is type-only, erased at build),
 * so client and server components can both read it.
