/**
 * The surfaces one account can open — the customer app, plus whichever operator
 * portals that account is entitled to.
 *
 * This exists because a single person here is often two things at once: the
 * owner's phone is an admin account *and* the account they shop with. Portals
 * each have their own door (see portals.ts), which fixed sign-in landing you in
 * the wrong app — but it left no way to *move between* the apps you legitimately
 * hold. That is what this list drives: the "where do you want to go" chooser
 * after sign-in, the console rows on the customer profile, and the way back from
 * a console to the app.
 *
 * It is presentation only. Nothing here grants access: every link still lands on
 * a layout that calls `requireRole()` / `requireVendorAccess()`, and RLS sits
 * under that. Getting this list wrong shows someone a door they cannot open —
 * never one they can.
 *
 * Pure and side-effect free (the `Role` import is type-only), so client and
 * server components can both read it.
