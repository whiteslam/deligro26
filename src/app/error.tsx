/**
 * The app-wide error boundary.
 *
 * Every data-access call in this app throws on a real failure rather than
 * returning empty — a page that renders "no orders" during a database outage is
 * worse than one that admits it broke, because an operator will act on the
 * empty list. That design only holds up if something catches the throw; without
 * this file it reaches Next's default error page, which is unstyled, escapes
 * the phone frame, and offers no way back.
 *
 * `error.message` is deliberately not shown. Next replaces it with a generic
 * string plus a digest for anything thrown in a Server Component precisely so
 * that connection strings and row contents do not reach the browser. The digest
 * is safe and is what matches this to the server log, so that is what we show.
