/**
 * The rider's own details.
 *
 * Platform: BOTH is not a meaningful answer here — the courier app has one
 * shell, the phone frame (see `driver/layout.tsx`). No `ConsoleOnly`, no
 * container-query columns; this is a phone screen and only ever a phone screen.
 *
 * Why it exists at all: the customer's tracking screen already renders
 * "{rider} is heading to you" (`lib/utils/order-status.ts`) and falls back to
 * "Your courier" when `profiles.full_name` is empty. The caption was never
 * missing — riders simply had nowhere to set the name it reads. That is the
 * whole feature, and it is why the name field carries a line saying so.
 *
 * Almost entirely assembly. `ProfileEditSheet` and `ProfileAvatar` are already
 * role-agnostic and already post to `/api/profile` and `/api/profile/avatar`,
 * both of which authorise any signed-in user, rate limit, and make a phone
 * change consume an OTP delivered to the NEW number. No new endpoint, no new
 * server action, no migration: `full_name`, `phone` and `avatar_url` have all
 * existed on `profiles` since 0001/0012.
