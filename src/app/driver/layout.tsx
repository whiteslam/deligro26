/**
 * The courier app runs in the phone frame, not the console shell.
 *
 * It used to render `.dashboard-shell` — the responsive web layout built for
 * the admin and vendor consoles — capped at 640px. On a laptop that produced a
 * 640px column of full-width cards floating on a page, which is not a thing any
 * rider will ever look at: the driver app is used one-handed, on a phone, at a
 * gate, and nowhere else. `.device` is the same frame the customer app uses, so
 * the layout being developed against is the layout that ships.
 *
 * No app↔web switch, unlike admin and vendor. Those two have a genuine desktop
 * audience — an operator at a desk, a kitchen with a tablet on the pass — and
 * the toggle exists so they can work at the size they actually have. There is
 * no desktop courier, so a switch would only offer a layout nobody should pick.
 *
 * The 80px foot padding on the scroller matches the other phone shells; there
 * is no tab bar here (the courier app is one screen), so it is breathing room
 * above the home indicator rather than clearance for a bar.
