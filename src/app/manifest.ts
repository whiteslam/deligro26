/**
 * Web app manifest — what makes the app installable.
 *
 * The root layout has always declared `appleWebApp: { capable: true }`, so
 * home-screen install was intended from the start; without this file Android
 * Chrome never offers it and the app can only be reached by typing a URL. In a
 * tier-3 market that is often the difference between a repeat customer and a
 * one-time visitor, and an installed vendor board is far less likely to be
 * closed by accident than a browser tab.
 *
 * It also matters for the push notifications this app already sends. OneSignal
 * is wired up and the server fans out order events (notifyOrderAccepted,
 * notifyOnTheWay, notifyDelivered) — installability is what makes those
 * reliably deliverable on Android.
 *
 * `start_url` is the customer feed, not a portal: operators reach their console
 * through /switch after signing in, and an installed icon that opened the admin
 * panel for a shopper would be the wrong front door.
