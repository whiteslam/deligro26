/**
 * GET /api/restaurants/:slug/payment-options
 *
 * Which payment methods this shop takes, and its cash ceiling. The checkout
 * screen only learns which restaurant the basket belongs to on the client (it
 * lives in the cart store), so the page cannot resolve this server-side the way
 * it resolves the platform-wide toggle — hence a small read endpoint.
 *
 * This is advisory. /api/orders re-resolves the same rules from the database
 * and refuses the order itself, so a stale or tampered response here changes
 * what the customer is SHOWN, never what they are allowed to do.
 *
 * Deliberately not rate-limited beyond what the platform provides: it is a read
 * of three booleans that migration 0034 grants to `anon` outright, and the
 * checkout calls it once per basket. AGENTS.md §6 asks for a limit on every
 * write endpoint; this writes nothing.
