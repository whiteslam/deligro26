/**
 * GET /api/app-version?app=rider|customer&versionCode=<int>
 *
 * The update check for the two Android apps. They are built outside this repo
 * and installed from a direct `.apk` — there is no Play Store to notice a bad
 * build — so this is the only way to tell a fleet it is out of date.
 *
 * No auth: an app has to find out whether it is too old to run BEFORE it has a
 * session to ask with. Nothing here is private either — a version number and a
 * download URL both ship inside every APK already.
 *
 * Writes nothing, so no rate limit (AGENTS.md §6). The one moving part is
 * `platform_settings`, which is public-read by policy, and the answer is the
 * same for every caller.
 *
 * **Fails open, deliberately, and for free.** `getSettings()` never throws — an
 * unreadable or un-migrated backend gives back the `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` shape,
 * where every version code is 1. Any real installed build has a versionCode
 * >= 1, so it compares as neither behind the latest nor below the minimum and
 * this route answers "you are current" with no fallback branch to write. That
 * is the safe direction here: AGENTS.md §2 is about authorization, and this
 * grants nothing — failing the other way would force-update an entire fleet off
 * the back of a transient database fault, with an APK URL we could not read.
 * (Contrast `outageSettings()`, which fails *closed* on `acceptingOrders`. Same
 * outage, opposite safe direction, because that field gates money.)
