/**
 * POST /api/obs/client — a browser reporting its own error.
 *
 * The one endpoint in this feature that anyone on the internet can call, which
 * makes it the one that needs the most suspicion. It is treated as hostile
 * input throughout:
 *
 *   * **Rate limited by IP** (AGENTS.md rule 6). There is often no session here
 *     — a crash on the login screen is exactly the crash worth hearing about —
 *     so `clientIp` is the key, and the cap is low. A browser that is genuinely
 *     broken emits a handful of errors, not hundreds; anything above the cap is
 *     a loop or an attack, and neither deserves a row.
 *   * **Nothing is trusted.** Every field is re-derived or clamped here. The
 *     caller cannot choose its own `level`, `kind`, `severity`, `env`, actor or
 *     order id — if it could, a script could write `critical` production issues
 *     into an operator's triage queue, or attribute its noise to somebody
 *     else's account.
 *   * **The actor comes from the session, never from the body.** If there is no
 *     session the row is anonymous, which is the honest answer.
 *   * **Redaction still applies.** `emit()` runs it regardless of where the
 *     event came from, so a page that puts a token in an error message cannot
 *     launder it through here.
 *
 * Answers 204 in every non-rate-limited case, including for a body it decided
 * to discard: telling a caller which of its payloads were rejected is a probing
 * oracle, and a browser can do nothing useful with the answer anyway.
