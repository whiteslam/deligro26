/**
 * POST /api/refunds  { orderId, reason? } — a customer asks for their money back.
 *
 * The refunds table has had a customer-request RLS policy since 0001 and no way
 * for a customer to reach it: there was no endpoint, no button, and therefore no
 * queue. This is that way in.
 *
 * What the client does NOT get to send is the amount. It is read from
 * `orders.total` inside `requestRefund` — the one number a customer has an
 * obvious reason to choose for themselves, and since 0026 the insert policy
 * refuses anything above the order total even if this route were bypassed.
 *
 * Only a finished order can be refunded (delivered or cancelled). An order still
 * in the kitchen is cancelled, not refunded, and that path already returns the
 * money on its own.
