/**
 * Scheduled dispatch sweep — see lib/dispatch/sweep.ts for what it does.
 *
 * Authenticated by `CRON_SECRET`, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`,
 * which is the header Vercel Cron attaches on its own. Fails closed: with no
 * secret configured the route refuses everyone (AGENTS.md rule 2) rather than
 * becoming a public "push every admin" button.
 *
 * Scheduling it is optional. The vendor and rider boards already trigger a
 * throttled sweep after their polls (`maybeSweepDispatch`), so this matters
 * for the hours when no board is open. Every-minute schedules need Vercel Pro
 * (Hobby allows daily only — a per-minute entry fails the deployment), which
 * is why no `vercel.json` entry ships with it. Alternatives: Supabase
 * `pg_cron` + `pg_net`, or any external pinger hitting this URL each minute.
