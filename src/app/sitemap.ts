 * owns — the queries that matter are "<dish> bemetara" and "<shop name>", and
 * they land here.
 *
 * Only ever lists what `listRestaurantsResult` returns, which is already scoped
 * to approved, publicly-readable shops by the same grants the storefront uses
 * (migration 0022). There is no second, laxer query here to keep in sync — a
 * sitemap that lists a shop the app will not render is a soft 404 to a crawler.
 *
 * Revalidated hourly rather than per request: a crawler hitting this should not
 * run a catalog query, and a new restaurant appearing within the hour is fast
 * enough for indexing.
