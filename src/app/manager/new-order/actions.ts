/**
 * The phone-order desk's three server actions.
 *
 * AGENTS.md #3: a Server Action is a public HTTP endpoint, so every export here
 * opens with `requireRole`. `["manager", "admin"]` matches the /manager layout,
 * which admits both — gating on "manager" alone would render the screen for an
 * admin and then bounce every button they pressed.
 *
 * All three are rate-limited on the operator's own id. That is not boilerplate
 * on this path: `placeOrder` creates auth accounts and orders in other people's
 * names, and `lookup` answers "does this number have an account?", which run in
 * a loop is a subscriber-enumeration oracle. A manager can already read
 * `profiles` (0023) so neither is new exposure — but a stolen manager session
 * should cost an attacker time.
