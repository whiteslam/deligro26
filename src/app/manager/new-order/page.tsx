 * settings the bill will be computed from, and whether this database can record
 * who took the order at all — so the composer opens ready to type into rather
 * than fetching while somebody waits.
 *
 * `requireRole` repeats the layout's gate on purpose: this page is reachable
 * directly, and a screen that writes orders in other people's names does not
 * get its authorization second-hand from a parent that could be refactored.
