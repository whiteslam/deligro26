/**
 * "We already paid this one" — settled on the spot, from the preview table.
 *
 * The case it exists for: an operator pays a shop for a single delivery in cash
 * or over UPI during the week, then builds the weekly batch and has to remember
 * to leave that order out. Marking it here records the payment as a one-order
 * settlement (`setOrderPaidAction`, migration 0034) — the same record the Order
 * payouts screen writes — and because `previewSettlement` skips any order that
 * already sits in a settlement, the row drops out of this list and out of the
 * batch total on the next render. The arithmetic is not adjusted by hand
 * anywhere; the order simply stops being unsettled.
 *
 * That is also why this is not a checkbox: it writes a payment record with a
 * reference, and it is undone by voiding that record, not by unticking a box.
 * The confirm names the amount for the same reason — this is money leaving.
