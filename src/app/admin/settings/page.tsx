/**
 * Settings home = a menu, not a form. Each row is a tap target that routes to
 * the screen that owns it (platform config, the ops shortcuts). The actual
 * editing lives on the sub-pages so this stays a clean settings tab.
 *
 * There is no Account section: MFA was removed in migration 0033 and the
 * security screen with it, so a row leading there would be a dead link. Admin
 * sign-in is a password alone — that is logged as accepted risk P-1 in
 * docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md, which is where it belongs, not in a settings menu
 * that would imply there is something here to configure.
 *
 * Sections marked `phoneOnly` are the phone's second half of its navigation.
 * Five bottom tabs cannot carry eleven destinations, so everything without a
 * tab is listed here — derived from ADMIN_PHONE_MENU rather than hand-written,
 * so adding a nav item cannot silently strand it on a handset. In the console
 * the rail already lists all of it, and showing the same link twice there would
 * only be noise, so these sections drop out at `@3xl`.
 *
 * Platform configuration is the exception: it is console-only, so the phone
 * gets a note explaining where it went instead of a row that leads to one.
