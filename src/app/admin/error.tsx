/**
 * Error boundary for the admin section.
 *
 * Scoped here so a failed screen renders inside the admin shell — the layout
 * supplies `.device` / `.app-shell`, so this must not add its own — leaving the
 * operator in the portal instead of dropping them on a bare full-page error.
 *
 * The admin data layer throws rather than degrading: `getCustomerDetail` throws
 * on a failed profile read, and the probed selects in `admin-orders.ts` throw on
 * anything that is not a missing column. That is the right call — an operator
 * shown an empty order list during an outage will act on it — but it only holds
 * up if something catches the throw, which is what this is.
 *
 * `error.message` is not rendered. Next replaces it with a generic string for
 * anything thrown in a Server Component so that query text and row contents
 * cannot reach the browser; the digest is the safe half and is what ties this
 * screen to the server log — searchable in the console at
 * /admin/observability, which is where the matching `onRequestError` record
 * carries the same digest and the real stack.
