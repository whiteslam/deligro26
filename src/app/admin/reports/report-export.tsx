 * Getting a report out of the browser.
 *
 * Excel goes through the shared branded workbook builder (`@/lib/reports/xlsx`)
 * so this sheet and a settlement statement leave the building looking like the
 * same company sent them — masthead, title, period, generated-at.
 *
 * PDF goes through the browser's own print dialogue ("Save as PDF"), not a
 * bundled PDF library. That is a deliberate trade: a PDF renderer is ~300 KB of
 * JavaScript shipped to every admin, it would need its own table layout code,
 * and its output would drift from what this page shows. Print CSS renders the
 * page the reader is already looking at, paginates properly, and costs nothing.
 * The button says "Save as PDF" because that is the option the dialogue offers.
