/**
 * Observability → Payments.
 *
 * The page exists to answer one question quickly, because it is the first
 * question of every payment incident and answering it wrongly costs an
 * afternoon: **is this Razorpay or is it us?**
 *
 * Those are two different measurements and they are kept apart on purpose:
 *
 *   * **Their side** — the provider error rate, from `obs_events`: how many
 *     calls to Razorpay failed or timed out.
 *   * **Our side** — the reconciliation, from `payments` joined to `orders`:
 *     how many payments Razorpay says are paid that this platform never
 *     recorded against an order.
 *
 * The second is the one that matters most and the one that survives longest. It
 * is derived from the money rather than from a log, so it outlives the 14-day
 * telemetry window entirely — and every row in it is a customer who has been
 * charged and is looking at an order that says unpaid.
