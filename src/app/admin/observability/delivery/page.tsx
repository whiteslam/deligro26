/**
 * Observability → Delivery.
 *
 * Dispatch is best-effort by design and swallows its own failures — the module
 * says so in its own header — so before this page the only symptom of a broken
 * assignment was an order sitting at "ready" with nobody able to say why.
 *
 * The distinction that makes this page useful: **riders online but nothing
 * assigned** is a software problem, and **nobody online** is an operations one.
 * They look identical from the order side and need completely different people.
