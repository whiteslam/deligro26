/**
 * Observability → Incidents.
 *
 * An issue is a bug; an incident is the work of handling one. They are separate
 * records because they have different lifetimes and different readers: issues
 * are deleted at 180 days, and incidents are **never** auto-deleted.
 *
 * That is the point of this screen. Retention exists so the raw stream does not
 * cost more than the platform, but an outage the team gets to have twice is
 * more expensive than any amount of storage — so the notes, the sequence of
 * decisions and the resolution stay for good.
