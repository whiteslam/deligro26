/**
 * Observability → API. Per-endpoint volume, error rate and latency.
 *
 * Built from `obs_metrics_rollup`, not from raw events, so it keeps working
 * past the 14-day raw window — the only way "is this worse than last month?"
 * stays answerable, which is the question that turns a number into a judgement.
 *
 * Two caveats are stated on the page rather than buried in a doc, because both
 * change how the figures should be read:
 *
 *   * **Call counts are sampled.** Fast successful requests are kept at 10%;
 *     anything that failed or took over a second is kept in full. So the error
 *     RATE is understated and the error COUNT is exact — which is the useful way
 *     round, and unusable if nobody says so.
 *   * **Percentiles across a window are approximate.** Each minute's p95 is
 *     exact; the figure here is the worst of them, which over-reports slightly.
 *     For a latency number that is the right direction to be wrong in.
