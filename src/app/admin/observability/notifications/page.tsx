/**
 * Observability → Notifications.
 *
 * The half of the platform that used to be completely invisible. `sendPush`
 * returned `false` on any failure and `pushToPlayer` discarded even that, so
 * "customers stopped being told their order was on its way" produced no signal
 * at all — not a log line, not a counter, nothing.
 *
 * What this page does NOT show, because it cannot: delivery. OneSignal accepting
 * a notification is not a handset displaying one, and Renflair accepting an SMS
 * is not a phone receiving one. Both would need a webhook back from the provider
 * that this platform does not have. "Accepted" is the honest word, and the page
 * uses it.
