 * Admin → one order.

 * The lifecycle is the subject of this screen, so it is drawn first and drawn
 * whole: one timeline from "placed" to "delivered", rather than the two
 * separate stage lists this page used to carry — an order lifecycle in one
 * panel and a delivery lifecycle in another, four panels apart, which left the
 * reader interleaving two sets of timestamps by eye to answer "so where is it".
 *
 * Everything else is context for that: who and where on the right, what was
 * ordered and what it cost below, and the intervention controls last, where a
 * destructive action is not the first thing under the cursor.
 *
 * ## Unknown is not the same as un-reached
 *
 * This deployment may predate migrations 0025 (payment columns) and 0026
 * (lifecycle stamps). Where it does, the stage says "not recorded by this
 * database" instead of "not yet" — because concluding that a kitchen never
 * accepted an order it did accept is exactly the mistake a row of blanks
 * invites. `AdminOrderDetail` carries `lifecycleKnown` and `paymentKnown` for
 * this, and both are honoured here.

/**
 * The order's whole life as one list, kitchen and delivery interleaved in the
 * order they actually happen.
 *
 * The two lifecycles are stored separately — `orders` carries accepted/ready
 * (0026) and `deliveries` carries assigned/picked-up/delivered — and this is
 * the only place they are stitched together. The page used to render them as
 * two stage lists four panels apart, which left the reader interleaving two
 * sets of timestamps by eye to answer "so where is it".
 *
 * ## Reached-ness comes from the status, not from the timestamps
 *
 * This is the important part. A stage is done because the order has *moved
 * past* it, which `orders.status` states directly and which is true on every
 * deployment. Reading it off the timestamp instead makes every stage look
 * un-reached on a database that predates the migration which added the stamp —
 * so a delivered order rendered as "Delivered · not yet", and an operator
 * checking whether a kitchen ever accepted an order would have concluded it
 * had not. The stamps are used for one thing only: saying *when*. Where a stage
 * is done and its stamp is missing, it says so.
 *
 * Cancellation replaces the tail rather than appending to it: a cancelled order
 * did not go on to be delivered, and leaving three grey "not yet" rows under it
 * implies it is still waiting for a rider.
