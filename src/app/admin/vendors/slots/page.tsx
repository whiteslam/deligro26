 * The ten places at the top of the customer feed, edited as one screen. The
 * vendor table's inline Slot select answers "pin this shop while I'm looking at
 * it"; this answers the other question — "what does the top of the feed look
 * like right now, and in what order" — which a paginated, filterable table
 * cannot show, because the ten shops that matter are scattered across its pages.
 *
 * Both write through setVendorPosition, so the one-shop-per-slot rule holds
 * wherever the operator is standing.
 *
 * Live, because it is not the only way in: the vendor table pins too, and a
 * second operator can be pinning while this one arranges. A stale board here
 * costs more than on most screens — every control is "put X in slot N", so
 * acting on an out-of-date occupant silently evicts whoever really holds it.
