/**
 * QA — the courier app's three screens.
 *
 * The courier app was one screen until History and Profile were added, and the
 * layout's doc comment said so in as many words. Three things are worth holding
 * in place now that it is three.
 *
 * 1. **No fabricated rider data.** `driver/page.tsx` carries a long comment
 *    about the time invented jobs ("Blue Tokai Cafe", ₹62, in a city Deligro
 *    does not operate in) and a fabricated ₹640 of earnings were offered to
 *    real riders, with a "Demo data" label carrying the whole weight of it.
 *    Demo rows are allowed ONLY behind `!isSupabaseConfigured`, where there is
 *    no backend to contradict them. A history of deliveries somebody never made
 *    is that same mistake with a longer memory.
 *
 * 2. **History is scoped to the session, never the URL.** `getDriverHistory`
 *    runs through `createAdminClient()`, which is past RLS, so its
 *    `.eq("driver_id", …)` IS the authorization (AGENTS.md rule 5). A driver id
 *    read from a query string would be an IDOR onto every rider's history.
 *
 * 3. **Every screen is reachable, and the tab bar agrees with the routes.** An
 *    orphan screen under /driver is one nobody can get to from the app; a tab
 *    pointing at a route that does not exist is a 404 on the bottom bar.
 *
 * Reads source. Runs offline — no Supabase, no network.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run test:driver-app
