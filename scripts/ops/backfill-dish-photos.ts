/**
 * OPS — attach library photos to dishes that have none.
 *
 * Why this exists: a shop whose dishes carry no photo renders as a column of
 * identical coloured squares, because `PhotoTile` falls back to the shop's
 * `accent_tint`. On the search tab — which is dish-first — that reads as if one
 * image had been stamped over the whole menu. At the time of writing 537 of
 * 4,247 dishes were in that state.
 *
 * Read the numbers before trusting this script too far: the catalog's 3,710
 * photographed dishes are drawn from just 48 distinct image URLs, every one of
 * them already shared between shops and one of them used by 41 shops at once.
 * So this closes a gap ("a coloured square") with something only slightly
 * better ("a generic stock photo of roughly the right food"). The real fix is
 * photographs of the actual food in `food_images`, which is empty.
 *
 * It reuses the matcher the vendor menu editor already uses
 * (`lib/images/match.ts`), which is the point: the rule that "paneer" must
 * never receive a chicken photo lives in one place and is not re-implemented
 * here. `bestMatch` refuses anything ambiguous — a bare "Biryani" against a
 * library of six biryanis returns null — so a dish this script skips is a dish
 * a person should pick for, not one to guess at. A visible gap gets fixed; a
 * confidently wrong photo sits there until a customer finds it.
 *
 * Two sources, because the obvious one is currently empty. `--source library`
 * reads `food_images`, the admin photo library, which is what the vendor menu
 * editor matches against. `--source catalog` (the default) treats the catalog
 * itself as the library: 3,710 dishes already carry a photo, the same names
 * recur across shops, and a "Cold Coffee" that one kitchen has photographed is
 * a better answer for another kitchen's "Cold Coffee" than a coloured square.
 * Both go through the same matcher and the same refusal rule.
 *
 * Dry run by default. It writes to live menu data, so `--apply` is deliberate.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/ops/backfill-dish-photos.ts                    # report only
 *   npx tsx scripts/ops/backfill-dish-photos.ts --apply            # write
 *   npx tsx scripts/ops/backfill-dish-photos.ts --source library
 *   npx tsx scripts/ops/backfill-dish-photos.ts --shop "Chatkara"
